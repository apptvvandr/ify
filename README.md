THIS PROJECT IS NOT USEABLE RIGHT NOW. EARLY ALPHA OF ALPHA!

I made this as I could'nt find an easy PHP tool to stream my music.

As I'm learning PHP/JavaScript/JQuery/CSS/Bootstrap... It may not be a very beautifull code. Moreover, it's full of various tests ...

ISSUES, FIXES and TODOS:
- PHP SANITIZE filter doesn't allow to use 'lesser than' comparison char in IQL
- Fix for the proper way to get config.ini
- Add a DB fields: user (for a per user database directory), tagLenght
