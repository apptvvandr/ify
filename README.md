THIS PROJECT IS NOT USEABLE RIGHT NOW. EARLY ALPHA OF ALPHA!

I made this as I could'nt find an easy PHP tool to stream my music.

As I'm learning PHP/JavaScript/JQuery/CSS/Bootstrap... It may not be a very beautifull code. Moreover, it's full of various tests ...

CHANGELOG
- Ify can now serve music from ID
- Improving libray scan, now between 10 and 15 files scaned per seconds instead 3 before :p
- First version of IQL, a basic query language for Ify
- New and secure way to manage mp3 handling for streaming or downloading. Can serve other files as well.


ISSUES, FIXES and TODOS:
- PHP SANITIZE filter doesn't allow to use 'lesser than' comparison char in IQL
- Fix for the proper way to get config.ini
- Add a DB fields: user (for a per user database directory), tagLenght
